    <h2>Quick Spanikopita that is fantastic!</h2>
    <p>This is a quick Spanikopita that uses puff pastry to save time.  It is a great version of a Greek classic!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Cooking Spray</li>
        <li>1 bunch spinach</li>
        <li>3 green onions, diced</li>
        <li>1/4 fresh dill, chopped</li>
        <li>1 tsp minced garlic</li>
        <li>Salt & pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Cheese: Feta - 4oz., parmesan - 4oz., and shredded mozzarella - 5oz.</li>
        <li>2 sheets of puff pastry, thawed</li>
    </ul>   
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees and grease a large baking sheet with the cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Heat a large pan over medium heat. Saute the spinach, green onions, dill, garlic, salt, and pepper until the spinach begins to release its liquid.</li>    
        <li>Combine the cheese with the spinach and mix completely.</li>
        <li>Place one sheet of puff pastry on the baking sheet and use a wet fingertip to moisten the edges. Spoon the spinach and cheese mixture into the center, leaving a 1/2-inch border around the edge. Carefully lay the second sheet of pastry on top and press down the edges to seal. Cut two slits in the top to let steam escape, then spray the surface with cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 15 to 20 minutes, or until golden brown. Allow it to cool for 5 minutes, then slice into sections with a pizza cutter.</li>
    </ol>
